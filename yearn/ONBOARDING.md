### Pain points 

### User Experience 

- No '1 click' way to add RPC information through Web3 Provider 

- How to communicate instructions such that there is no issue with this part?

+ Styling components to show user that they are connected to the backbone? 
> e.g. turn the wallet connected button into something different 

### SDK and Tooling 

+ typescript / javascript 

- Additional Branding and UI Assets (React only)
